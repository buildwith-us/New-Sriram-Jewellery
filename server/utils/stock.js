 *    the only write in that flow. Reserving at confirmation would leave every
 *    COD order decrementing nothing.
 * 2. Much of this catalogue is one-off pieces. Selling the same piece twice
 *    means telling a customer who has already paid that their piece is gone,
 *    which is far worse than briefly holding a piece for a checkout that is
 *    later abandoned.
 *
 * The cost is real and deliberate: a card order that is created but never paid
 * holds its stock until something releases it. Cancellation and owner rejection
 * both release (see releaseStock). What is NOT yet covered is an order that is
 * simply abandoned at the Razorpay screen — that needs a sweeper for unpaid
 * pending orders older than N minutes, which is not in this change.
 *
 * Note that `stock: 0` blocks ordering. The product page already treats 0 as
 * out of stock, so this only makes the server agree with what the customer is
 * already being shown.

 *
 * Each order is claimed with a conditional update before its stock goes back.
